<h3>Propert-Managment-System</h3>
<p> This is a project done for a data structure course. 
I utilized the linked list structure to build the frame and body of the project.<br>
The project includes 
<ul>
<li> Adding property</li>
<li> Deleting property</li>
<li> Searching through the properties</li>
</ul>

Don't be mislead by the single file ðŸ˜‰
Enjoy
